//! A conditional rule behavior template class that includes child rule support.
//
// This class provides conditional behavior extensions for session rules and basic management of child rules
// that make it easier for the programmer to create a rule.
//
// There are two different modes a ConditionalScenarioBehavior-derived rule can operate in: polled and 
// un-polled.  
//
//
// <bi Polled Mode><br>
// In polled mode, the rule runs a polling thread that waits for something to happen/reach a certain state.
// When the required event has happened, all child rules will be started and once they have all finished,
// this parent rule will complete itself. 
// 
// A conditional rule that runs in polled mode is made by overriding Init() and implementing GetConditionResult().  
// The Init() method needs to be overridden so that the <l ConditionalScenarioBehavior::m_pollingBehavior  m_pollingBehavior>
// flag can be set to true.  Further details on this are in the Init() method's description.
//
// GetConditionResult() will be used by the <l ThreadPollCondition()  polling thread> to determine if the
// conditions required for the rule to be 'activated' are met.  When GetConditionResult() does return true,
// all of the child rules (if any) are started.  Once the child rules have completed, this rule will complete
// itself.
//
//
// <bi Un-polled Mode><br>
// When not running in polled mode, a conditional behavior rule behaves as a simple 'use-once action' rule
// where once un-paused, GetConditionResult() is called to do the rule's work.  If it returns true, the child
// rules will be run through to completion and this rule will complete itself.  If GetConditionResult() 
// returns false, the rule will just complete itself without doing anything else.
//
//
// <bi Examples><br>
// All of the following rules use the ConditionalScenarioBehavior class:
//  - <l astSrcRuleConstChk            Consist Check>
//  - <l astSrcRuleResourceCheck       Resource Check>
//  - <l astSrcRuleTriggerCheck        Trigger Check>
//  - <l astSrcRuleVariableCheck       Variable Check>
//  - <l astSrcRuleDisablIconNotif     Disabled HUD Icon Notification>
//  - <l astSrcRuleDrivCmdChk          Driver Command Check>
//  - <l astSrcRuleMultJuncCheck       Multiple Junction Alignment Check>
//  - <l astSrcRuleMultResrcCheck      Multiple Resource Check>
//  - <l astSrcRuleWaitCamera          Wait for Camera View Mode>
//  - <l astSrcRuleWaitHUDIconClick    Wait for Click on HUD Icon>
//  - <l astSrcRuleWaitDerail          Wait for Derailment>
//  - <l astSrcRuleWaitDriverOnOff     Wait for Driver On/Off Train>
//  - <l astSrcRuleWaitHTMLPages       Wait for HTML Pages>
//  - <l astSrcRuleWaitMinimap         Wait on Minimap Screen/Main Screen>
//  - <l astSrcRuleWaitTrainStopStart  Wait on Train Stop/Start>
//  - <l astSrcRuleWaitWaybill         Wait on Waybill Screen/Main Screen>

	//! Updates the child rules.
	//
	// This method is used to handle and update the child rules.
	//
	// When called, if this rule is not <l IsComplete()  complete> or <l IsPaused() paused>, any child rule
	// that hasn't been run will be started.  If the child rules have completed, this method will complete

	//! Action/verification method that <bi must> be implemented by the programmer to make a conditional rule.
	//
	// This is the method of the conditional rule that the script programmer must implement.  What this method
	// does is largely up to the programmer.  Depending on whether this rule is running in 
	// <l ConditionalScenarioBehavior::m_pollingBehavior  polled mode> or not determines how you will go about
	// programming this method.
	//
	// If the conditional rule is running in polled mode, then ThreadPollCondition() will keep calling this
	// method every second to see if the rule's conditions are satisfied.  Your implementation should return 
	// true if the conditions of your rule have been satisfied so ThreadPollCondition() knows when it can move
	// on and run the child rules etc.
	//
	// If the conditional rule is not running in polled mode, this method will be called by ExecuteRule() just
	// once to perform the rule's required actions.  If true is returned (i.e. the actions were successful),
	// the child rules will be run.  Otherwise this rule will be completed without doing anything further.
