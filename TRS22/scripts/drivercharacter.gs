//! A driver character is a driver asset that can be attached to a Vehicle and drive the Train by following a schedule.
//
// For each driver character asset found, %Trainz creates a DriverCharacter object that is now part
// of the list of drivers in World.  Drivers can be added and removed from World through the
// World::AddDriverCharacter() and World::RemoveDriverCharacter() methods.  A list of all drivers
// that currently exist in the %Trainz world can be obtained by calling World::GetDriverCharacterList().
//
// Messages sent from a DriverCharacter game object are:
//  [ Major             | Minor         | Source  | Destination | Description                     ]
//  [ DriverCharacter   | Removed       | Driver  | World       | Driver deleted from the world   ]
//  [ DriverCharacter   | Created       | Driver  | World       | New Driver added to the world   ]
//  [ DriverCharacter   | LeftTrain     | Driver  | Driver      | Driver has left a locomotive    ]
//  [ Train             | DriverLeft    | Train   | Driver      | Driver has left a locomotive    ]
//  [ DriverCharacter   | BoardedTrain  | Driver  | Driver      | Driver assigned to a loco       ]
//  [ Train             | DriverBoarded | Train   | Driver      | Driver assigned to a loco       ]
//  [ DriverCharacter   | OwnerChanged  | Driver  | World       | Driver owner has changed        ]
