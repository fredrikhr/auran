//! Track defines an uninterrupted stretch of rail between two objects of interest (e.g. <l Junction  junctions>, <l Industry  industries> etc.).
//
// This class is used to control the flow of <l Train  trains> from a scripting perspective.  While
// somewhat analogous to the signaling system, the Track Graph is currently a completely distinct
// entity.  The graph provides basic path finding and clear-route enforcement through the Permit 
// system.  The graph is currently used solely from the game scripts, primarily when a Train is
// running a Schedule.  The game engine's autopilot functionality uses the signaling system only.
//
// Tracks are not currently named; the only reliable way to obtain a Track reference is to be given
// it by the game engine during Schedule construction (see DriverCharacter) or from the 
// <l Message::src  source> of a (<m"%Train">, <m"EnterTrack">) message (which is sent to the Train
// concerned).
//
// Messages that a Track object sends are:
//
// {[ Major    | Minor              | Source  | Destination  ]
//  [ "Train"  | "EnterTrack"       | track   | train        ]
//  [ "Train"  | "InnerEnterTrack"  | track   | train        ]
//  [ "Train"  | "InnerLeaveTrack"  | track   | train        ]
//  [ "Train"  | "LeaveTrack"       | track   | train        ]}
//
// All track sections and trains have a priority value in the range of [1 - 3] with the default 
// value being 2.  The priority value for tracks and trains is not a numerical scale of precedence,
// but rather a value to user for matching by the AI driver.  This means the driver will try and
// take the train along track sections that have a priority equal to that of the train.
//
// For example, a driver in control of a train that has a priority of 1 will try and take the train
// along track sections with a priority of 1 whenever possible.  As the priorities don't work on a
// precedence basis, the driver in this example will not favor a track section with a priority of 2
// over one with 3 and vice-versa.
//
// Priority values are not a mechanism for specifying an explicit route for a driver to take and
// should not be thought of in that way.  Rather, it is about being able to specify preferences
// that the driver will follow when possible.

  //     vertex) in such a way that a physical flow across the shared vertex is possible 
  //     (ie. they're not on the same side of a junction or etc.) Returns DIRECTION_NONE if
