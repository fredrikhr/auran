//! A driver character is a driver asset that can be attached to a Vehicle and drive the Train by following a schedule.
//
// For each driver character asset found, %Trainz creates a DriverCharacter object that is now part
// of the list of drivers in World.  Drivers can be added and removed from World through the
// World::AddDriverCharacter() and World::RemoveDriverCharacter() methods.  A list of all drivers
// that currently exist in the %Trainz world can be obtained by calling World::GetDriverCharacterList().
//
// Messages sent from a DriverCharacter game object are:
// {[ Major              | Minor           | Source  | Destination  | Description                     ]
//  [ "DriverCharacter"  | "LeftTrain"     | driver  | broadcast    | Driver has left a locomotive.   ]
//  [ "DriverCharacter"  | "BoardedTrain"  | driver  | broadcast    | Driver has been assigned to a locomotive.  ]
//  [ "DriverCharacter"  | "Created"       | driver  | broadcast    | Driver has been newly created.  ]}
//  [ "DriverCharacter"  | "OwnerChanged"  | driver  | broadcast    | Driver owner has changed.       ]}
//
